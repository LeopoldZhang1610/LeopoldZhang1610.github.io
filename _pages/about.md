## About Me

I am Haichuan Zhang, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. My research focuses on **trustworthy machine learning**, particularly the **security, robustness, and privacy** of generative models and AI-driven systems. I am broadly interested in developing reliable, explainable, and safe ML systems that perform robustly in real-world settings.

Before joining the University of Utah, I obtained my **Master’s** and **Bachelor’s** degrees in Computer Science at **Anhui University**, where I developed a strong interest in generative models and AI security.

My current work investigates: 
- **Backdoor attack and alignment** on large language models  
- **Robustness and defense** of diffusion models 
- Broader security and safety issues in **generative ai**, and **embodied ai** systems  

I enjoy building practical and theoretically grounded methods that enable trustworthy AI.
